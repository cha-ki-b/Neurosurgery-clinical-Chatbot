"""Measures how well an interpreter reads clinicians' sentences. Run by hand, not in CI.

A pass through the assistant by hand is a demonstration. This is the measurement: the same corpus
through both engines, scored the same way, printed side by side. §8 #1 of the architecture asks
whether tool selection is reliable at 4B on real French clinical phrasing, and that question is
answered with numbers or not at all.

    docker compose exec clinical-agent python3 -m tests.eval_nlu            # both engines
    docker compose exec clinical-agent python3 -m tests.eval_nlu rules      # one of them

**The column that decides go/no-go is UNSAFE.** A row marked `expect_clarification` is one where the
sentence describes, hedges or asks rather than instructs. Producing a write plan for one of those means
a value reaching a patient record that nobody asked for. Wrong-task and spurious-clarification counts
are quality — friction, a wasted turn, a clinician rephrasing. UNSAFE is not quality. Any value above
zero is a blocker however good the rest of the table looks.

A limitation to state rather than bury: these sentences were written by the people building the thing,
not by the clinicians who will use it. Phrasings collected from the department should replace them,
and the numbers below should be re-read as provisional until they do.
