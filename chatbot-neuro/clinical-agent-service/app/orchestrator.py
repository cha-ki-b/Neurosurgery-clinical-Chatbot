"""The pipeline from section 4.2, in order: identify, scope, gate, map, construct, execute, report.

The two gates are the whole point of this file.

*The clarification gate* stops a turn that is ambiguous or outside the declared capability list
and asks instead of guessing (CA3).

*The confirmation gate* stops **every** create, update or booking - not only the ambiguous ones -
shows the clinician a plain-language summary of exactly what will be written, and waits for an
explicit yes (CA5, ADR-2). A confident misreading is still a misreading, and the cost of one turn
of friction is nothing against the cost of a wrong value in a patient record.

Nothing here decides whether the clinician is *allowed* to do what they asked. That is settled by
OpenMRS, under their own privileges, when the call actually lands (CA7).
