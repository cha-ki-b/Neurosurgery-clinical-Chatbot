"""Deterministic French/English interpretation of a clinician's turn (Phase 2 - no LLM).

Rules rather than a model, on purpose and only for now. Phase 2's whole point is to prove the
security and audit model end to end; doing that with an interpreter whose behaviour is fully
enumerable means a failing test points at a rule, not at a sampling temperature. Phase 3 swaps
this out for MedGemma behind the same interface.

Two behaviours here are not merely "phase 2 simplifications" and should survive that swap:

* **Descriptive phrasing is not an instruction.** "Le GCS s'est aggrave a 6" reports a course;
  "note un GCS a 6" requests a write. Anything hedged, reported or interrogative is sent back as
  a clarifying question instead of being acted on. This is the concrete risk the architecture
  document flags in section 0, and it belongs in whatever interpreter is in use.
* **Never guess between task families.** A turn matching two families is ambiguous, full stop.
