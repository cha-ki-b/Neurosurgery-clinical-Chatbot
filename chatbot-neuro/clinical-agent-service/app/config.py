"""Deployment settings, all from the environment.

Nothing here has a default that would let the service start up insecure: the channel secret and
the token verification key have no fallbacks, and :func:`Settings.validate` refuses to run without
them. A misconfigured assistant that refuses to start is an outage; one that starts and accepts
unsigned identities is a patient-safety incident.
