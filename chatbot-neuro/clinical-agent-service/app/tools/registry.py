"""The versioned list of things the assistant is able to do, and nothing else.

Every action the assistant can take is a registered tool with a declared shape: which task family
it serves, which slots it needs, whether it writes, and which OpenMRS capability it depends on.
That declaration is what makes task identification grounded rather than open-ended - the
interpreter's job is to name a tool and fill its slots, not to invent an endpoint - and it is
what a Phase 3 model will be constrained against instead of generating free-form calls.

A tool whose dependency the deployed OpenMRS does not advertise is *disabled with a reason*, not
quietly broken. That distinction matters in a clinical setting: "je ne peux pas programmer de
rendez-vous sur cette installation" is actionable, an unexplained failure three steps later is not.
